# text_sentence_finder
This code takes a text and creates a file with all the sections that include an input word. Useful if you want to read through long text quickly, 
but only sections that include a word. The main function (paragrapher) requires a list of all sentences in the text to work.
I currently have two functions that do this, although I hope to add more. One of them (inneficient_sentence_divider.py) is very inefficient,
the other (sentnecer.py) requires an extrnal library called Natural Language Tool Kit (ntlk) that needs to be downloaded for the
function to work. I hope to add more ways to divide a text into sentences in the future.
